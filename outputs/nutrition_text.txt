60When | first wrote to you in 2019, | spoke of my admiration for Plan International (India Chapter),
fondly referred to by many as Plan India, and its efforts as a leading Indian NGO committed to
promoting rights for children and girls from underprivileged families and communities.
This year, we have made new strides in our mission to support and uplift the lives of children,
particularly girls, from poor and underprivileged families. | am humbled to share that our community
development programs have created positive outcomes for more than 18.90 lakhs (1.80 million)
children, including girls, boys, young women, and men across 27 states of our country. We
implemented comprehensive strategies to ensure that more than 1,50,000 girls and boys from
underprivileged families gain access to quality education in government schools from pre-primary to
senior secondary levels.
We have worked collectively with government and community stakeholders to strengthen youth
economic empowerment by supporting 18,500 young women and men from urban slums and
villages with job-oriented vocational skills and job placement. Aligned with the Government's
adolescent and young health program, we have supported awareness and capacity building for
5,40,000 adolescent girls and boys, as well as, young women and men, to practice health seeking
behaviour and make well-informed decisions on their health and well-being. Furthermore, 90,000
girls and young women have been supported with information and linkages to the government’s
gender equality schemes and programs to protect them from all forms of violence, abuse and
exploitation. Through our integrated nutrition and early childhood development interventions, we
have positively impacted the lives of over 100,000 children. Our humanitarian relief efforts during
the year has benefitted nearly 75,000 disaster affected people and their families for meeting their
immediate needs of food, nutrition, hygiene and healthcare.
| extend my heartfelt gratitude to our invaluable donors, civil society partners, government
stakeholders and community champions of change for their unwavering support and meaningful
collaboration in achieving these important milestones. As we step into the next year, our passion
and determination remain unwavering in our pursuit to champion early childhood development.

36Through the project, we enhanced maternal nutrition by delivering hot, nutritious meals to
malnourished pregnant women at their homes in Bikaner district of Rajasthan. This approach met
their additional calorie requirements, leading to improved outcomes for both mothers and newborns.
We provided support to 375 pregnant women, delivering a total of 33,668 nutritious meal packets
while also educating them about healthy hygiene and sanitation practices.
As a result, none of the pregnant women in the programme experienced weight loss during their
pregnancy. All 140 babies born had adequate birth weights, ranging from 2.5 kg to 3.5 kg, with no
cases of low birth weight. Furthermore, 69 percent of pregnant women with a normal Body Mass
Index (between 18.5 and 23.0) gained weight according to established standards after being
exposed to the intervention for 60 days or more. The initiative also fostered entrepreneurship
among women’s groups. Nineteen women, recognized as “Poshahar Mitra’, were promoted as
entrepreneurs within their communities.
The project improved the nutritional status of children under 2 years of age in 57 urban slums across
two districts in Telangana state. It has reached out to 5,120 pregnant women, lactating mothers, and
children aged up to 2 years through home visits and awareness campaigns. Over 3,200 pregnant
women and lactating mothers have received Ante-natal Care and Post-natal Care services by being
linked with Anganwadi Centres and receiving regular follow-ups. The initiative also bolstered 62
Anganwadi Centres with materials like Stadiometer, Infanto-meter, digital baby weighing scale, and
adult and child weighing scale, facilitating accurate growth monitoring. Knowledge about the causes
of child malnutrition has increased significantly, with 65 percent of pregnant women (compared to
20% at baseline) and 69 percent of lactating mothers (compared to 20% at baseline) having been
made aware.
The project is implemented in two tribal districts of Maharashtra, two tribal districts of Gujarat, and
one district in Rajasthan with a target towards reduction by 40 percent in the number of children
under 5 who are stunted, and to decrease and maintain childhood wasting at less than 5 percent.
It focuses on the critical first 1,000 days of life and employs innovative digital modules to enhance
the health, hygiene, and nutrition of pregnant women and children. The project created awareness
on nutritious diet in 18,455 households. The project provided support to more than 4,150 pregnant
women, including 3,875 with high-risk pregnancies, as well as 2,764 malnourished children in the
reporting period. Additionally, 500 children have been connected to Nutrition Rehabilitation Centres.
The project uses a digital application to collect and track the health and nutritional status of the
pregnant women, lactating mother and newborn babies and a token amount is transferred to the
beneficiary bank account (parent of the SAM child) through $2B (Straight to Bank) after verification.
An assessment conducted this year showed that 88 percent of the SAM children were referred to
the NRCs and 77 percent of the SAM children have improved their nutritional status to MAM (33%
of the SAM moved to normal) and 55 percent of the MAM children have moved to normal.
